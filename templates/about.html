  <p>I am in my fourh year of studies at Link√∂ping Univerity to become a Master of Science in Engineering focusing on computer science and media techology. Together with three other students, I was part of founding the organization called <a href="http://lithehack.se">LiTHehack</a>, which exists to help other students learn programming. During the last four summers I have worked as a software developer at <a href="http://configura.com/cet/why-cetdesigner/">Configura</a>, with tasks including creation of tools to export 3D data to formats suitable for sharing on the web, as well as test driven integration of a triangulation algorithm for complex 2D polygons.</p>
